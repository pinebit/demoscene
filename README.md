# Demoscene
intro in 4k (demoscene)

The repo includes a pre-built executable (see demo folder).

For those who are not aware of what demoscene is, please refere to Wikipedia.
Here is what's cool about 4K intros:
- zero dependencies, even no stdlib!
- the app is created by a person/group from scratch: music, code, graphics, etc.
- the demo must run on virtually any Windows machine

This intro uses OpenGL for graphics rendernig, MIDI for music playback and WIN32 to deal with window and threads.

Hit any key to exit the demo at any time.

Hope you enjoyed!
